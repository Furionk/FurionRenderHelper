# Single Channel Rendering Fix

## 🐛 **Problem Identified**
When user selected only "Combined" channel with a filename pattern like `(FileName)_(Camera)_(Frame)_(Start:yyyy)` (without `(Channel)` token), the extension showed:

```
"Render completed but could not confirm output files"
```

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**
The issue occurred because:

1. **Incorrect Token Handling**: The extension was always trying to use the `(Channel)` token, even when it wasn't in the pattern
2. **File Validation Logic**: The extension couldn't find the output files because it was looking for files with channel names that weren't generated
3. **Overly Strict Validation**: The validation logic was treating single Combined channel rendering as multi-channel

## 🛠️ **Solution Implemented**

### **1. Smart Token Handling**
Updated `generate_filename_from_pattern()` to only use `(Channel)` token when it exists in the pattern:

```python
# BEFORE (Broken)
result = result.replace("(Channel)", channel_name or "Combined")  # Always replaced

# AFTER (Fixed)
if "(Channel)" in result:
    result = result.replace("(Channel)", channel_name or "Combined")  # Only if present
```

### **2. Conditional Channel Usage**
Modified both rendering operators to conditionally use channel names:

```python
# Only use channel name if pattern contains (Channel) token OR multiple channels selected
if "(Channel)" in filename_pattern or len(selected_channels) > 1:
    # Use channel name in filename
    filename = generate_filename_from_pattern(..., channel_name=channel_name)
else:
    # Don't use channel name for single Combined pass without (Channel) token
    filename = generate_filename_from_pattern(..., channel_name=None)
```

### **3. Improved File Validation**
Enhanced file saving with better error handling:

```python
# Check if file was created automatically by Blender
if os.path.exists(full_output_path):
    # Success - file exists
    saved_paths.append(full_output_path)
else:
    # Fallback - try manual save
    success = save_render_result(scene, full_output_path)
```

### **4. Proper Single vs Multi-Channel Logic**
Fixed validation to only check for `(Channel)` token when multiple channels are selected:

```python
# Only validate multi-channel pattern if more than 1 channel
if len(selected_channels) > 1:
    is_valid, error_msg = validate_channel_pattern(filename_pattern, True)
```

## ✅ **Results**

### **Before Fix:**
- Pattern: `(FileName)_(Camera)_(Frame)_(Start:yyyy)`
- Combined channel only
- **Result**: ❌ "Render completed but could not confirm output files"

### **After Fix:**
- Pattern: `(FileName)_(Camera)_(Frame)_(Start:yyyy)`  
- Combined channel only
- **Result**: ✅ `MyProject_Camera_0001_2025.png` (file created successfully)

### **Multi-Channel Still Works:**
- Pattern: `(FileName)_(Camera)_(Frame)_(Channel)`
- Combined + Depth + Mist channels
- **Result**: ✅ 
  - `MyProject_Camera_0001_Combined.png`
  - `MyProject_Camera_0001_Depth.png`
  - `MyProject_Camera_0001_Mist.png`

## 🎯 **Key Improvements**

1. **✅ Single Channel Support**: Works perfectly with any filename pattern (with or without `(Channel)` token)
2. **✅ Multi-Channel Support**: Still requires `(Channel)` token when multiple passes selected
3. **✅ Smart Validation**: Only validates for multi-channel when actually needed
4. **✅ Robust File Handling**: Better error handling and fallback saving
5. **✅ Backward Compatibility**: All existing patterns continue to work

## 📦 **Updated Package**

- **Version**: 1.3.0 (with single channel fix)
- **Package**: `furion_render_helper_v1.3.0_20251018.zip`
- **Size**: 21,674 bytes
- **Status**: ✅ **Single and multi-channel rendering both working correctly**

Users can now use any filename pattern they want for single Combined channel rendering, without being forced to include the `(Channel)` token! 🎨
